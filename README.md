Introducing KLGWN, if you're interested


Caution: This information is private. It concerns to who want to know my vision and is eager to go on this journey with me.

My name is Vieira Ntwali Isimbi. I likw watching animes and mangas. That's among my hobbies. When I wacthed Hunter x Hunter anime, I was tremendrously inspired by how Gon, Killua, Kurapika and Leorio faught to reach their goals.

However, the best thing that made me be more inspired is the friendship btn Gon and Killua that made a Win-Win achievement when they worked together in love to reach there goals. That inspired me to start a plan of working on my goal that was always in my heart since I was a kid. I wanted to solve people's problems--just that. May be it might feel I want to disguiss myself as a hero, but it's not that: I really love people of the World and I really want to kill problems that hold continuous tears on their chicks. On

For KLGWN, It simply means Killua Gon. This two boys really hold a peace in my hearts and I really want to be like them. I wish I had a friendship like theirs but if you want to make it with me, just text me on IG (vieirantwali).

So Action starts NOW.
